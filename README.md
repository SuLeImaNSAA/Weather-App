# Weather-App
Simple weather app using ReactJs . Just search for any city in the world and you will get the weather info in it.

In this project, I used Axios to fetch the weather API from the OpenWeatherMap API. For the weather info, I fetched the country and city name, the temperature and wind speed, and finally, the Icon with the description. The main hooks I used are useState and useEffect. I also used the material UI for the text field and the button.
