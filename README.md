# Weather-App
Simple weather app using ReactJs . Just search for any city in the world and you will get the weather info in it.

In this project I used axios to fetch the weather api , and I fetch it from openwathermap api. About the weather info , I fetched the country and city name , the temp and wind speed, and finaly the Icon with the description . The main hooks I used are : useState and useEffect. And I did used the material ui for the text field and the button.
